            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong>The color scheme of the website is easy on the eyes and fits well with the animations.  </li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The design is clearly established and followed throughout. The lists and organizations don't feel out of place and improve the site.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment of the page is clear and concise. When scrolling down the page each element is visually connected.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> The site's proximity is done well. Each piece of information is nested around other pieces of information that relate to one another and makes sense.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/" target="_blank">Hacker News</a></h3>
            <p>Hacker News is a website designed around posting new updates within the hacking community.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> The contrast is awful and hard to look at. Bright colors that seem to be thrown together.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is repitition in the site due to the fact that their isnt much of anything here. It's simply a list of posts.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The alignment is centered to make the posts easy to scroll through, however the left alignment leaves lots of space to the right of the page.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> There is almost no proximity within the site. None of the posts are related to one another and are stacked by how recently they were added.</li>
