        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Bella Brown is a studying historian at East Carolina University, with a concentration in historical studies and a minor in ethnic studies. She has written on multiple topics, 
            such as North Carolinaâ€™s development, Colonial America life, and resegregation in southern public schools. She is aiming to get her masters later in life and continue to write on 
            American history. Brown is motivated to continue her academic journey to not only use her research to correct misconceptions about American history, but also to make historical 
            learning more accessible to the general public with her background as a previous history education major.
